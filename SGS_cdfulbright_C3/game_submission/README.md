# Wildlife Protector Game

## Overview
This project is a simple and engaging web-based game designed to raise awareness about endangered wildlife. Players learn to distinguish between common and protected animal species in an interactive way. The goal is to make environmental education fun and accessible to a broad audience.

The game challenges players to "catch" falling animals with their mouse. Points are awarded for catching common animals, while touching an endangered species results in a penalty, teaching players through direct interaction.
